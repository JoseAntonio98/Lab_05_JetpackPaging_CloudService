## Statement

In a Cloud service, a variety of services can be found to implement the backend for mobile solutions, such as storage service. On the other hand, pagination is recommended for visualizing large amounts of data. Within that context and considering the project (final project) that is being developed, develop an application with the following characteristics:

- The application has a UI interface that allows entering three data points corresponding to the data obtained from the sensor (sensor of your project), for example: date and time, sensor reading or measurement, and a comment/note/observation.
- After entering the data, it is sent to the Cloud service where it is stored.
- The application has an interface from where all the stored data can be viewed. The visualization is done using pagination.
- The visualization interface should display at least four pages with a minimum of 10 records per page.
- The application should be fully functional (including data) for review.
- The application should be developed using Jetpack Compose.
- Firebase is not accepted as a storage service.
